We're asked to determine the amplitude and the. Of y equals negative
1/2 cosine of 3x of the first thing we have to ask ourselves is what
does amplitude even refer to will the amplitude of a periodic function
is just half the difference between the minimum and maximum values.
It takes on the fire to drop periodic function like this and if we
just go back and forth between to order a little bit neater goes
back and forth between two values like that. So between that value
in that value, you take the difference between the two and half of
that is the amplitude another way of thinking about the amplitude
is how much does its way? How much does its way from its middle position?
Right over here. We have y equals -1/2 cosine of 3x. So what is
going to be the amplitude of this?
 Well the easy way to think about it is just what is the code what
is multiplying the cosine function? And you could do the same thing.
This is if it was a sine function, we have negative one-half multiplying
it so the amplitude the amplitude the amplitude in this situation
is going to be the absolute value the absolute value of -1/2 which
is equal to one eye and you might say well, why do I not care about
the sign? Why do I take the absolute value of it? The negative display
lips the function around it's not going to change how much it's weighs
between its minimum and maximum position. The other thing is well,
how is it just simply the absolute value of this thing and realized
why you just have to remember that a cosine function or sine function
varies between positive 1 and -1 if it's just a simple function.
So this is just multiplying that positive one or negative one. And
so if normally the amplitude
 If you didn't have any cool fishing here, if the coefficient was
positive or negative one, the amplitude would just be one now you're
changing it or you're multiplying it by this amount. So the amplitude
is 1/2. Now. Let's think about the. Let's think about the. So the
first thing I want to ask you is what does the. Of a of a cyclical
function even or periodic function? I should say. What does the.
Of a periodic function even refer to?
 Well, let me draw. Let me draw some axes on this function right
over here. Let's say that this right over here is the y axis.
 That's the y-axis and let's just say for the sake of argument.
This is the x-axis right over here. So the. Of a periodic function
is the length of the smallest interval that contains exactly one
copy of the repeating pattern of that periodic of that periodic function.
So what do they mean you're well, it's repeating so we go down and
then up just like that. Then we go down and then we go up. So in
this case the length of the smallest interval that contains exactly
one copy of the repeating pattern. This could be this could be one
of the smallest repeating patterns. And so this length so this like
between here and here would be one. Then we could go between here
and here is another. And there's multiple this isn't the only pattern
that you could pick you could say. Well, I'm going to find my pattern
starting here going up and then going down.
 Like that so you could say that's my smells like and then you would
see that. Okay. Well, if you go in the negative Direction the next
repeating version of that pattern is right over there. But either
way you're going to get the same length the same length that it takes
to repeat to a repeat that pattern. So the given that what is the.
Of this function right over here?
 Well to figure out the. We just take to Pi to Pi and / the absolute
value of the coefficient right over here. So we / the absolute value
of 3, which is just three so we get to Pi to pi over 3. Now. We need
to think about the why does this work? Well, if you think about just
a traditional cosine function between a traditional cosine function
or traditional sine function. It has a. Of 2pi if you think about
the unit circle if you think about the unit circle
 2 pi if you started 0 2pi radians later, you're back to where you
started to Pi radians another to buy your back to where you started
to go in the negative 2. If you go in the negative Direction you
go negative to buy your back to where you started for any angle here.
If you go to buy your back to where you are before you go negative
to buy your back to where you were before. So the periods for these
the periods for these are all to Pi.
 And the reason why this makes sense is that this coefficient makes
you get to 2pi or negative in this case two pies going to make you
get to 2pi all that much faster. And so it gets your. Is going to
be a lower number takes less like they're going to get to 2pi three
times as fast. Now you might hear all of this was a negative number
it would get you to -2 Pi all that much faster. But either way you're
going to be completing one cycle visualize these two things. We draw
let's actually draw negative one-half -1/2 cosine of 3x. So, let
me draw my access year.
 My best attempt to this is my y-axis. This is my x-axis and then
we draw some so this is 0 right of your ex's equal to zero and let
me drive X is equal to positive 1/2. I'm driving right over here.
So X is equal to positive 1/2 and we haven't shifted this function
up or down any then we if you wanted to we could add him a constant
out here outside of the cosine function, but this is positive 1/2
positive 1/2, or we could just right at that as 1/2 and then down
here. Let's say that this is -1/2 negative 1/2 in to let me draw
that bound. I'm just driving to started line so they come easy for
me to draw and what happens when what happens when this is zero when
cosine cosine of 0 is 1 * -1/2
 Husband to be negative 1/2 and it be negative 1/2 right over here
and it's going to start going up. It's going to start going up.
 Then I can only go in that direction to bounded. It's going to
start going up then we'll come back down.
 And then it will get back to its original to that original point
right over here. And the question is what is this distance? What
is this length? What is this length going to be? Well, we know what
it's. Is is 2 pi over 3. It's going to get to this point three times
as fast as a traditional cosine function. So this is going to be
to pi over 3, and then if you give it another two pi over 3, if you
gave it another 2 pi over 3 is going to get back to that same Point
again. So if you go another two Pi / 3.
 So in this case you've now gone for pi over 3 for pi over 3, you
completed another cycle. So that length right over. There's a. And
you can also do the same thing. You could also do the same thing
in the negative Direction. So this right over here this right over
here be negative -2 pi over 3 and to visualize the amplitude. You
see that it can go 1/2, you will destroy you think about it the the
difference between the maximum and the minimum point is one half
of that is 1/2 or you could say that it's it's going 1/2 in magnitude
for or it's it's swaying 1/2 away from its middle position in the
positive or or the negative Direction.
