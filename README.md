# PencilBuds: Empower students with ADHD

> No need for earbuds. Say hi to PencilBuds!
A HooHacks 2021 project

## Problem

- Since COVID, much of the learning have turned online
- Countless students learn by watching video lecture
  - Numerous benefits of video lectures
  - Easy to access
  - Quality education for free
- However, they are nonstarters for kids with ADHD
  - Way too long! (often over 20 minutes)
- Unable to access this resource, the students often cannot do as well in schoolwork
- This issue can even negatively impact their mental health

## Solution

- A web app that condenses long video lectures to short notes
- It will help students with ADHD do better in (online) school and boost their confidence, providing them the much-needed empowerment

## What it does

- Retrieve (often lengthy) lectures from YouTube
- Convert the video caption into transcript
- Summarize the text to concise notes
- Notes can be viewed as a web page, or exported to PDF

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Material UI
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: Postgres
- Authentication: JWT
- Text Summarization: Sumy
